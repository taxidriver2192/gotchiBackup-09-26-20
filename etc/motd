Hi! I'm a pwnagotchi, please take good care of me!
Here are some basic things you need to know to raise me properly!

If you want to change my configuration, use /etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml

All the configuration options can be found on /etc/pwnagotchi/default.toml,
but don't change this file because I will recreate it every time I'm restarted!

I'm managed by systemd. Here are some basic commands.

If you want to know what I'm doing, you can check my logs with the command
tail -f /var/log/pwnagotchi.log

If you want to know if I'm running, you can use
systemctl status pwnagotchi

You can restart me using
systemctl restart pwnagotchi

But be aware I will go into MANUAL mode when restarted!
You can put me back into AUTO mode using
touch /root/.pwnagotchi-auto && systemctl restart pwnagotchi
