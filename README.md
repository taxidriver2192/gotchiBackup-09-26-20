# PWNAGOTCHI: DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR WIFI PWNING!

How does Pwnagotchi work?

Instead of merely playing Super Mario or Atari games like most reinforcement learning based “AI” (yawn), Pwnagotchi tunes its own parameters over time to get better at pwning WiFi things in the environments you expose it to.

To be more precise, Pwnagotchi is using an LSTM with MLP feature extractor as its policy network for the A2C agent. If you’re unfamiliar with A2C, here is a very good introductory explanation (in comic form!) of the basic principles behind how Pwnagotchi learns. Be sure to check out the Usage doc for more pragmatic details of how to help your Pwnagotchi learn as quickly as possible.
